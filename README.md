# Design Thinking Project: MindSync Integrated System with E-Learning

### Overview:
This repository contains the **Design Thinking** project for the **MindSync Integrated System with E-Learning**. The project aimed to develop a solution that helps UTM students manage their stress by integrating academic tasks with e-learning. This solution includes a personalized to-do list, progress tracking, and mental wellness tools to assist students in managing their deadlines and reducing anxiety. The system was designed through the **Design Thinking** process, which includes the following stages: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.

### Reflection:
My goal as a software engineering student is to develop software to fulfil my own needs for creativity while also helping others bring their ideas to life. This project taught me to focus on user needs, emphasizing empathy, collaboration, and iteration, which aligns with my goal of creating impactful software. To improve my potential, I plan to gain hands-on experience through internships, work on my problem-solving skills, and stay updated on new technologies.
